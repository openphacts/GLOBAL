# Open PHACTS Platform Issues

## File "problem-calls-encoded.csv"

File containing a list of LD API calls, extracted from recent GitHub Issues, that resulted in errors or issues.

GitHub Issues are here: [GLOBAL Issues](https://github.com/openphacts/GLOBAL/issues)

First entry on each line is the GitHub Issue number. The leading domain part of the URL (e.g., "http://beta.openphacts.org/2.1" is stripped off.  Any "app_id=" and "app_key=" query parameters are also removed, leaving just the core, common API call.
